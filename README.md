# Smart Home Automation System

This project is a feature-rich home automation system powered by modern sensors and the ESP32 module. It provides enhanced safety, convenience, and automation using components like RFID cards, motion detection, and environmental sensors.

## Components Used

1. **Servo Motor**: Used to automate physical mechanisms like door locks or window blinds.
2. **Flame Detector**: Monitors for fire hazards and triggers alerts.
3. **Rain Detector**: Detects rainfall to trigger actions like closing windows or retracting outdoor awnings.
4. **ESP32 Module**: Acts as the main controller, providing Wi-Fi connectivity for remote access and data handling.
5. **RFID Card**: Enables secure access control for doors or specific devices.
6. **Motion Detector**: Detects movement to enhance security or automate lighting.
  
## Features

- **Secure Access**: Use RFID cards to unlock doors or activate specific devices.
- **Fire Safety**: Automatically alerts users and takes action (e.g., activating alarms) when a flame is detected.
- **Rain Automation**: Automates actions like closing windows or sending notifications when rain is detected.
- **Motion-Based Automation**: Turns lights on/off or triggers alarms when motion is detected.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Access real-time sensor data and control devices via Wi-Fi using the ESP32 module.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Automates lights and appliances based on user presence and environmental conditions.

## How It Works

### Workflow:
1. The **ESP32 module** connects to all sensors and actuators, processing real-time data.
2. The **RFID module** authenticates users, controlling access to specific features.
3. The **motion detector** triggers automation tasks like switching lights or activating alarms.
4. The **flame detector** sends alerts and activates safety measures upon detecting fire.
5. The **rain detector** monitors weather conditions and automates relevant actions.
6. The **servo motor** executes physical actions, such as locking/unlocking doors or adjusting blinds.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/home-automation.git
   cd home-automation
   ```

2. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the sensors (flame detector, rain detector, motion detector) and actuators (servo motor) to the ESP32 module as per the circuit diagram in the `docs/` folder.
   - Wire the RFID reader to the ESP32 for secure access control.

3. **Software Setup**:
   - Install the necessary libraries:
     - ESP32 board package
     - `MFRC522` for RFID
     - Any required libraries for sensors
   - Upload the firmware to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Update Wi-Fi credentials and other parameters in the source code:
     ```cpp
     const char* ssid = "YOUR_SSID";
     const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";
     ```

5. **Run and Test**:
   - Power up the ESP32 and ensure all components are connected.
   - Use the serial monitor to verify sensor data and automation workflows.
